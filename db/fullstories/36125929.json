In the second half they were better and got in behind but we felt comfortable, we defended well. </paragraph><paragraph>\"It was a great piece of individual skill with lots of creativity, Saul is developing well which is great for us.</paragraph><paragraph>\"I think it's still an open tie, they will be playing at home next week with their fans behind them but we have the chance to get an away goal. It'll be a close game like today, we'll see who makes the most of their chances.\"</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres: </bold></paragraph><paragraph>\"It was a fantastic night and I'm happy for all Atleticos. We've got the lead we wanted.</paragraph><paragraph>\"We kept fighting, that's what we do. Bayern have a level that few other teams have but we kept on doing our thing.\"</paragraph><paragraph><bold>Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola:</bold></paragraph><paragraph>\"Their goal is a brilliant goal, but it's our mistake. We kept standing off. I'm not happy with how we played.   </paragraph><paragraph>\"It was a good game overall, but we started badly. The goal was a consequence of our slow play.\" </paragraph><crosshead>What's next?</crosshead><paragraph>Both teams continue the pursuit of their domestic league titles this weekend.</paragraph><paragraph>Second-placed Atletico, who are level on points with leaders Barcelona, host lowly Rayo Vallecano as they bid for a second La Liga title in three seasons.</paragraph><paragraph>Bundesliga champions-elect Bayern also play on Saturday when they host fifth-placed Borussia Monchengladbach.</paragraph><crosshead>Stats of the day</crosshead>  <list type=\"unordered\">    <listItem>Atletico have won 13 of their 17 home Champions League games under Diego Simeone, drawing three and losing one.</listItem>    <listItem>Atletico have scored against 23 of the 25 teams they have faced this season in all competitions, only failing to score against Villarreal and PSV Eindhoven.</listItem>    <listItem>Bayern Munich are winless in their past eight away games in the Champions League knockout stages, drawing four and losing four.</listItem>    <listItem>Robert Lewandowski has failed to score in eight of his past nine Champions League games outside the Allianz Arena.</listItem>    <listItem>Bayern defender David Alaba made his 50th appearance in the Champions league - more than any other Austrian player.</listItem>  </list><include>  <title>Match Stats Body Include</title>  <path platform=\"highweb\" href=\"/inc/specials/sport/hi/sport/pal-wrapper/oppm-body.inc?match=EFBO851527\"/>  </include></body>",
